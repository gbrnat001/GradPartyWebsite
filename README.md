# Nathan Merid Ghebru's Graduation Party Website
My parents told me to I should make an invitation card, to send out to my friends.\
I thought that was too simple, and decided to instead make a website
to show that I had at least learned some Computer Science in the past 4 years.\
Anyway, the current link is [nathangradparty.com](https://nathangradparty.com)
